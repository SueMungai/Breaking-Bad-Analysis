An analysis on only the greatest series of all time, Breaking Bad. 


# 1. Business Understanding

## Overview
Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan.
### Plot 
Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White, an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. Walt turns to a life of crime and partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman, to produce and distribute crystal meth to secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld.
In 2013, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the most critically acclaimed TV show of all-time.

## The Project
This project was inspired by my new found love for the critically-acclaimed series. It will be an analysis of character dialogues: You can analyze the dialogues of different characters in Breaking Bad and see which characters speak the most, which words they use the most, and how their language changes over time.
